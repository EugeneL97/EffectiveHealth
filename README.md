# EffectiveHealth

EffectiveHealth is a World of Warcraft WeakAura designed to help you be proactive in your decision making of using your defensives in difficult content. Authored by Zeler and most recently maintained by Whisperwind.

It shows you how much physical and magic damage you can take. Based on current health, absorbs, and defensive cooldowns from yourself and others.

It has options to change how it looks, including the ability to show the current damage reduction instead of effective health. Check the custom options tab in-game to customize it.

It is not accurate in pvp, it is designed primarily for dungeons and raiding content.

Your armor and stagger is based on the level of your opponent. If you see it change when switching targets, that's why.

In mythic+ it will show you how much percent health you will have left after getting hit by specific abilities.
The incoming damage is not always fixed and may vary by a few percentages, so keep that in mind.

For the Dampen Harm's effect on the effective health number, it is assumed to be a 20% damage reduction. However, for the remaining health prediction it should be calculated correctly.
